# JS Date Libraries Comparison

This project is to compare the ability of `moment.js`, `luxon` and `date-fns` to handle utc offset changes.

Each library is required to **print start of today for UTC+4**

I have added my implementation of the 3 libraries. But I can't make `date-fns` right. Please try to correct my implementation in `date-fns-implementation.ts`.

## Run Project

```sh
yarn start
```
